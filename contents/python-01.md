## Introduction

- Python is a simple, easy to learn, **high-level, interpretive, general-purpose, free and open source,** and Powerful programming language.
- It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
- Python was introduced in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Dutch programmer **Guido van Rossum** at **CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) Research lab** in the **Netherlands**.
- Python based on _ABC, C, Bourne Shell, Modula-3, Perl, Haskell_, and _Lisp_
- Named after Guido's favourite BBC comedy TV show "_Monty Python's Flying Circus_"

## Key Features of Python

1. **Easy to learn and Use:**
   - It has a simple structure, a few keywords, and clearly straightforward defined syntax.
   - There is no use of the semicolon or curly-brackets for defining scope in Python.
   - Its indentation (spaces or tabs) defines the block of code.
   - Therefore, Python programs are easy to read and understand.
2. **Expressive Language:**
   - Python (like Perl) is an expressive language. Its syntax is very easy.
   - We can perform complex tasks by writing a few lines of code in Python as compared to other programming language.
3. **Interpreted Language:**
   - Python is an interpreted based language similar to Perl and PHP.
   - It means its script code is executed one line at a time and not all at once, like in other programming languages. The line-by-line execution makes it easy to debugging the Python code.
   - Python has also a built-in debugging feature.
   - Beside it, Python is not a fully compiled language.
   - The code is automatically compiled into the machine readable byte codes and then executed.
4. **Cross-platform Language:**
   - Python is a cross-platform language, which means it is platform independent. We can run the Python code equally on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc.
   - This is because the source code of python first is converted to a machine readable byte code, which is then interpreted.
5. **Free and Open Source:**
   - Python is a free and open-source programming language. It is freely available for everyone. We can install it on our computer free of cost on any operating system with no copyright issues.
6. **Object-Oriented Language:**
   - Python supports object-oriented style of programming (OOP) that encapsulates the code within objects.
   - OOP is a modern programming paradigm that is based on the concepts of classes and objects.
   - It breaks up the code into several segments that messages back and forth using classes.
   - Object-oriented programming supports inheritance, polymorphism, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
   - Its procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop powerful applications in less code with a good level of abstraction.
7. **Interactive:**
   - Python is really interactive, so we can write a program directly on the Python prompt.
   - The advantage of being Python interactive is we can interact directly with the interpreter and get the immediate results.
   - We can also use the prompt to test out small bits of codes to see if they work
8. **Easy to Maintain:**
   - We can easily maintain the source code of Python programming language.
9. **Extensible Feature:**
   - We can integrate Python with other languages such as C, C++, and Java.
   - It allows us to execute the code written in other programming languages. This implies that we can compile the code in other languages like C/C++, or Java, and then can use that in our python code, which we can compile and run anywhere
10. **High-Level Language:**
    - Python is a high-level programming language, which means it enables the programmer to write programs that are not specific to a particular type of computer or designed for a specific task.
    - A high-level programming language is easier to write and understand.
    - Programmers can easily write and understand or interpret the code.
    - It is closer to human language and far to machine language.
    - For a computer to understand and run a program designed with a high-level language, we must compile it into machine language.
11. **Broad Standard Library:**
    - One of the main reasons for Python's popularity is its large standard library for the various fields such as machine learning, data science, web developer, and also for the scripting.
    - Python contains a rich set of modules and functions that are cross-platform.
    - Web Development Libraries: Django, Flask, Bottle, Tornado, Pyramid, web2py, CherryPy, CubicWeb
    - GUI Development Libraries: Tkinter, Libavg, PyGObject, PySimpleGUI, PyQt, PySide, Kivy, wxPython, PyForms
    - Scientific and Numeric Libraries: SciPy, Numpy, Pandas, IPython, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Matplotlib
12. **Dynamic Typed Language:**
    - Python is a dynamically typed language.
    - This means that the Python interpreter does type checking of variable at the runtime.
    - Interpreter assigns the type of variable based on the value of variable at the runtime.
    - We don't declare the data type of a variable explicitly in Python.
    - Interpreter decides the data type of variable and its memory allocation at runtime.
    - Interpreter automatically allocates the memory to the variable at runtime when we assign a value to the variable.
13. **GUI Programming Support:**
    - Python provides many graphical user interface (GUI) libraries that are used for the developing Desktop web application.
14. **Databases Support:**
    - When we develop an application, we may need a database.
    - Python language provides Python Database API (DB-API) that provides an interface to all major commercial databases.
    - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, Informix, etc. are some databases supported by standard python.
    - To use it, just import the interface for the particular database.
    - Using Python, we can work with both relational and non-relational databases.
15. **Automation Tool:**
    - Python is a great tool for the automation process.
    - We can write simple Python programs to automate routine tasks, such as repetitive or time-consuming.
16. **Scalable:**
    - This feature of Python provides a better structure and supports for large programs.

## Limitations of Python

- Python is an interpreter-based language. Therefore, it is slower in the terms of execution of programs as compared to other programming languages
- As we know python is a high-level language, it also uses several layers to communicate with the operating system and computer hardware
- Graphics applications such as video games make the program to run slower.

## What is an Interpreter

- An interpreter is simple software that executes the source code line by line
- An interpreter is a program/software that converts a programming language into Machine language that a computer can understand and execute.
- While Interpreting a code, an interpreter will report any error it finds in the code. If it does not find any error it will translate the code into Machine language.
- The Python interpreter's name is **CPython**. It is written in C Language.

## `print()` Function

- The `print()` function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
- The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.
- Syntax: `print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)`

```js showLineNumbers
print("Hello World!");

print(22 + 44);
```

**Parameter Values:**

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| object(s)         | Any object, and as many as you like. Will be converted to string before printed                        |
| sep = 'separator' | Specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one. Default is ' ' (Optional)              |
| end='end'         | Specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed) (Optional)                               |
| file              | An object with a write method. Default is sys.std out (Optional)                                       |
| flush             | A Boolean, specifying if the output is flushed (True) or buffered (False). Default is False (Optional) |

## Basic Structure of Python Program

1. **Documentation section:**
   - The documentation section consists of a set of comment lines giving the name of the program, the author, and other details, which the programmer would like to use later.
2. **Imports:**
   - The imports section provides instructions to the interpreter to link functions from the module such as using the import statement.
3. **Global variables section:**
   - Some variables are used in more than one function.
   - Such variables and are declared in the global declaration section that is outside of all the functions.
4. **Class definitions:**
   - Here, we can declare different classes.
   - Classes are a collection of data members and data functions.
5. **User-defined functions:**
   - This section also declares all the user-defined functions.
6. **Executable part:**
   - There is at least one statement in the executable part.

```python showLineNumbers
# Documentation Section
# Write a Program to show use of scope variable using function

# Import Section
import math

# Global Variables Section
x = 50

# Class Defination Section
class Person:

	# User Defined Functions
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name
		self.age = age

	# User Defined Functions
	def greet(self):
		print("Hello my name is "+self.name)
		print("My age is "+self.age)

# Executable Part

p1 = Person("John", "19")
p2 = Person("Alex", "20")

p1.greet()
p2.greet()
```

### Identifiers

- Identifier is a user-defined name given to a variable, function, class, module, etc.
- They are case-sensitive
- It is a good programming practice to give meaningful names to identifiers to make the code understandable.
- We can also use the `isidentifier()` method to check whether a string is a valid identifier or not.

**Rules for Naming Python Identifiers:**

- It cannot be a reserved python keyword.
- It should not contain white space.
- It can be a combination of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or underscore.
- It should start with an alphabet character or an underscore ( \_ ).
- It should not contain any special character other than an underscore ( \_ ).

### Variables

- Variable is containers that store values.
- Python is not statically typed.
- We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type.
- A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.

```python showLineNumbers
num = 12

name = "John Doe"
```

- Variable names can be any length can have capitalized, lowercase (start to finish, a to z), the digit (0-9), and highlight character( \_ ).
- **Local Variable:** The variables that are declared within the function and have scope within the function are known as local variables.

```python showLineNumbers
# Local Variable Example

def add():
	a = 15
	b = 25
	c = a+b
	print(c)

add()
print(c)
```

```Output
# Output
40
ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<main.py>", line 10, in <module>
NameError: name 'c' is not defined
```

- **Global Variables:** The variables that are declared globally and have scope in entire program known as Global variables.

```python showLineNumbers
# Global Variable Example
a = 15 # Global Variable
b = 25 # Global Variable

def add():
	c = a+b
	print(c) # Local Variable

print(c)

# Output: 40
```

#### Ways to Assign Variables

```python showLineNumbers
# 01. Declaring a varibale and assigning value

age = 19

# 02. Assigning Multiple Values

result = mark1, amrk2, mark3 = 78, 88, 84

# 03. Reassigning Values

temp = 10
temp = "Hello"
temp = False

# 04. Deleting a Vriable

del temp
print(temp) # ERROR: name 'temp' is not defined
```

#### User Input

- By default `input()` takes values as `String` type.

```python showLineNumbers
name = input("Enter Your Name: ")
age = int(input("Enter Your Age: "))

print(name)
print(age)
```

## Data Types

![](py/1py02.png)

#### Int Data Type

- In Python, the `int` data type is a numeric type used to **represent whole integer number** as opposition with `float` number.
- Creating a `int` is done by using the whole integer number without quotes or using the `int()` constructor function

#### Float Data Type

- In Python, the `float` data type is a numeric type that is used to **represent number with floating point values** as opposition with whole `int` number.
- Creating a `float` is done by using the number using the decimal point (`.`) without quotes or using the `float()` constructor function.

#### Complex Data Type

- In Python, the `complex` data type represents **complex numbers** that contain a real part and an imaginary part. In complex numbers, the real part and the imaginary part are floating-point numbers denoted by the suffix “j” or “J”.
- Complex numbers are used often in mathematical and scientific calculations.

```python showLineNumbers
# int Type
i = 3
print(type(i))  # <class 'int'>

# float Type
f = 3.1
print(type(f))  # <class 'float'>

# complex Type
z = 2 + 5j  # Real part: 2, imaginary part: 5
print(type(z))  # <class 'complex'>
```

#### Bool Data Type

- In Python, the `bool` data type is used **to represent Boolean values** (`True`, `False`). Booleans are used to evaluate expressions and return the Boolean `True` or `False` based on the result of the expression.

```python showLineNumbers
# Boolean expression
x = 10
y = 5

result = x > y
print(result)  # True
print(type(result))  # <class 'bool'>
```

#### Str Data Type

- In Python, the `str` data type is used to define text component enclosing a sequence of characters within single-quotes or double-quotes. Python strings can contain letters, numbers or special characters.

```python showLineNumbers
# String data type
greet = "Hello"
print(type(greet))  # <class 'str'>

# Print string
print(greet)
```

#### List Data Type

- In Python, the `list` data type is used to **store ordered sequence of elements**. Python lists are ordered collections that can contain elements of various data types (str, list, dicts, …). List elements can be accessed, iterated, and removed.
- Slicing or accessing elements of a list is done using the square brackets (`[]`) notation.
- Creating a list is done using the square brackets (`[]`) or the `list()` constructor function

```python showLineNumbers
ls = ['hello', 1, True, [1, 2]]

print(ls)  # ['hello', 1, True, [1, 2]]
print(type(ls))  # <class 'list'>
```

#### Tuple Data Type

- In Python, Tuples are a **data structure of the sequence type that store a collection of data**.
- Python Tuples have these 5 characteristics.
  - ordered
  - unchangeable
  - immutable
  - allow duplicate value
  - allow values with multiple data types
- Creating a tuple is done using the parentheses (`()`) or the `tuple()` constructor function.

```python showLineNumbers
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(t)  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(type(t))  # <class 'tuple'>
```

#### Dict Data Type

- In Python, dictionaries are **an unordered collection of key-value pairs stored as a `dict` data type**. Python dictionaries are a mappings data type used to store collections of data.
- Creating a dictionary is done adding key, value pairs inside curly brackets (`{}`) or using the `dict()` constructor function.
- Values in dictionaries can be selected passing the key string inside the square brackets (`[]`) of the dictionary object.

```python showLineNumbers
d = {
        'name': 'John',
        'last_name': 'Doe'
    }

print(d)  # {'name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe'}
print(type(d))  # <class 'dict'>
```

#### Set Data Type

- In Python, sets are **an unordered collection unique elements (no duplicate values)**. A Python `set` is a mutable object where you can add, remove, or modify elements after creating it.
- Creating a set is done adding comma-separated values inside curly brackets (`{}`) or using the `set()` constructor function.
- Python Sets have a multiple characteristics:
  - Duplicates are not allowed
  - They can have Multiple data Types
  - Sets Can’t Be Accessed with the Index
  - Not Subscriptable

```python showLineNumbers
s = {1,2,3}

print(s)  # {1, 2, 3}
print(type(s))  # <class 'set'>
```

#### Frozenset Data Type

- In Python, the `frozenset` data type **represents an immutable set**.
- Creating a `frozenset` is done using the `frozenset()` constructor function. Once created, you cannot add, remove, or modify elements to the `frozenset`.
- The difference between a `set` and a `frozenset` in Python is that the `set` is mutable and the `frozenset` is not. You can change a set by adding, removing or modifying its elements, but doing so with a `frozenset` would result in an error.

```python showLineNumbers
# set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.add(5)
my_set.remove(2)
print(my_set)  # {1, 3, 4, 5}

# frozenset
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Adding or removing elements from frozenset returns an error
my_frozenset.add(5)  # AttributeError
my_frozenset.remove(2)  # AttributeError
```

## Type Conversion

- The act of changing an object's data type is known as type conversion.
- The Python interpreter automatically performs **Implicit Type Conversion**.
- Python prevents Implicit Type Conversion from losing data.
- The user converts the data types of objects using specified functions in explicit type conversion, sometimes referred to as type casting.
- When type casting, data loss could happen if the object is forced to conform to a particular data type.
- **Implicit Type Conversion**: In Implicit type conversion of data types in Python, the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any user involvement.
- Explicit Type Conversion: The data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement. With explicit type conversion, there is a risk of data loss since we are forcing an expression to be changed in some specific data type.

```python showLineNumbers
# Implicit Type Conversion

celcius = 25
fahrenheit = (celcius*9/5)+32 # int -> float
print(fahrenheit) # 77.0

# Explicit Type Conversion

num = 15
number = str(num) # int -> string
print(number) # 15
```

## Conditional Statements

#### `if` Statement

- The if statement is the most simple decision-making statement.
- It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not.

```python showLineNumbers
num = 15

if (num%2 == 0):
	print("Number is Even)
```

#### `if-else` Statement

- We can use the `else` statement with the `if` statement Python to execute a block of code when the Python if condition is false

```python showLineNumbers
num = 15

if (num%2 == 0):
	print("Number is Even)
else:
	print("number is Odd)
```

#### `elif` Statement

- As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed.
- If none of the conditions is true, then the final “else” statement will be executed.

```python showLineNumbers
mark = 87

if mark>=90:
	print("Grade: A")
elif mark >= 75:
	print("Grade: B")
elif mark >= 60:
	print("Grade: C")
elif mark >= 40:
	print("Grade: D")
else:
	print("Fail)
```

#### Nested `if-else` Statement

```python showLineNumbers
# Example of nested if-else
x = 10
y = 5

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x == y:
        print("x is equal to y")
    else:
        print("This should never happen")
```

## Loop

#### `for` Loop

- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
- With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc

```python showLineNumbers
# Multiplication Table using For Loop

num = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
	print(num, "x", i, " = ", num*i)
```

```python showLineNumbers
# Iterating over a list

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### `while` Loop

- While loops are used in Python to iterate until a specified condition is met.
- However, the statement in the program that follows the while loop is executed once the condition changes to false

```python showLineNumbers
# Multiplication Table Using While Loop

num = 5
i = 1

while(i<=10):
	print(num, "x", i, " = ", num*i)
	i += 1
```

| **for Loop**                                                 | **while Loop**                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is used when the number of iterations is known.           | It is used when the number of iterations is not known                   |
| In case of no condition, the loop is repeated infinite times | In case of no condition, an error will be shown                         |
| Initialization is not repeated.                              | Initialization is repeated if carried out during the stage of checking. |
| Statement of Iteration is written after running.             | It can be written at any place.                                         |
| Initialization can be in or out of the loop                  | Initialization is always out of the loop                                |
| The nature of the increment is simple.                       | The nature of the increment is complex.                                 |
| Used when initialization is simple                           | Used when initialization is complex.                                    |

## Loop Control Statements

#### `continue` Statement

- This command skips the current iteration of the loop. The statements following the continue statement are not executed once the Python interpreter reaches the continue statement.

```python showLineNumbers
# Skip printing when i equals 2
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

#### `break` Statement

- This command terminates the loop's execution and transfers the program's control to the statement next to the loop.

```python showLineNumbers
# Break the loop when i equals 3
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

#### `pass` Statement

- The pass statement is used when a statement is syntactically necessary, but no code is to be executed.

```python showLineNumbers
for i in range(5):
    pass  # Loop does nothing
```
